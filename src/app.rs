                    it's pretty bland. In order to make it more exciting, you
                    have decided to more activities or \"event features\" to
                    the event. However, you must tow the line between a fun
                    event, or safety violation extravaganza."</p>
                <p>"You need to add features to the event to increase the fun
                    level, but each feature comes with its own risks. To
                    counteract the risk, you need to add various countermeasures
                    to ensure a safe, fun time for everyone."</p>
